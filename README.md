# Quarter Car Suspension Model

The suspension system is one of the most significant components of a vehicle, as it reduces the impact loads from the road to enhance the ride comfort and **stability**. Suppose a vehicle is traversing a random surface![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119739544/216402226-0002416a-51bd-4531-b963-8fa474108676.jpg)

, which causes the vehicle to jolt and cause discomfort for the passengers. The quantities Zs and Zu are vertical displacements in the car body and car wheel, respectively, due to displacement Zr induced by an uneven road. TThe quantity of interest here is $Zs-Zu$, which is the displacement seen here, and we can obtain step input responses from them. Anyway, these responses are not good for the practical application, as we can see that it is having overshoot, which causes discomfort to the passenger, so we remodel the system by adding a compensator, that will alter the overshoot and the settling time of the step response. Ideally, we would want systems which that lower overshoot and lower settling time. And assuming here that R(s) = 0, the block diagram further simplifies as shown. And for all different compensators, the final plot is this. We had tried all types of compensators to the system to obtain the optimum one. The system response is the blue coloured plot as shown we had seen that this has overshoot, now we try to make it better by adding compensators. For P compensator it is almost the same plot, there is nothing much difference, for PI also there is nothing much difference, whereas for PD if we see the overshoot and settling time vary and they both are less than that of system response which is good for us to use, similarly all followed but the standouts are PD compensator and PID compensator, PID also is good but it has more overshoot occurring in more time than PD compensator. So, by adding a compensator to the Quarter Car Suspension Model, we can make better systems, which are having lower overshoot and settling time and that are fitting well to the practical conditions.
